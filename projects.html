                    <p>Since 1997 we have had water projects for communities which live with 
                      clean water difficulties we have dag 62 wells,128 boreholes and 600 pipes. 
                      Extreme poverty cannot end until clean water, toilets and hygiene are a 
                      normal part of daily life for everyone, everywhere. Yet 785 million people 
                      live without clean water close to home, and 2 billion don't have a decent 
                      toilet of their own. And climate change is making the situation worse. 
                      Women in particular waste precious time walking long distances to collect 
                      dirty water. Girls drop out of school because there are no private toilets 
                      to manage their periods. And approximately 289,000 children per year do not 
                      live to see their fifth birthday because of diarrhoeal diseases caused by 
                      dirty water and poor sanitation. We may be called WaterAid, but our focus 
                      is resolutely on all three essentials: clean water, improved sanitation and 
                      proper hygiene.</p>

                    <p>Since 1992 we have taken donation in clothing and redistributed to needy 
                      communities. The clothing project has secured a 2-acre land for the 
                      construction of a school for  the children of Dwen Daama deprived rural 
                      community in the central region of Ghana which has no school. Our clothing 
                      project School shall provide a tuition-free education with free uniforms, 
                      free stationary, free lunch and all other needed things for the successful 
                      education of our beneficiaries. The purpose of this project is to make 
                      education accessible to the children of Dwen Daama and its surrounding 
                      villages, and boost motivation for education among the children and 
                      parents of the community, in pursuance of our mission to empower the 
                      less-privileged people of Ghana for a better future. We are counting on 
                      the support of kindhearted individuals like you to make this project a 
                      success. Your donation of US$ 6 would buy us one bag of cement for the 
                      construction of the school. Please donate today!</p>

                    <p>Since 2012 we have purschased non-prescription drugs and these OTC drugs 
                      have been supplied to needy people for first aid treatment. It started as 
                      a group of dedicated pharmacy students going on a pharmacy medical mission. 
                      Our patient clientele were poor impoverished patients of both rural and 
                      urban cities in Ghana. We struggled to obtain medications for the mission 
                      and shopped differrent retail pharmacies for vitamins, supplements, and 
                      analgesics. We would purhcase those on sale and clearance but often times 
                      we paid full prices for these medications. There was limited funding for 
                      the mission and most everything came out of pocket from team members, 
                      friends, and families. In 2009, we purchased 2 luggages worth of 
                      medications and treated approximately 1,000 patients within a 3 week 
                      mission. The medication list includes vitamins, supplements and OTC 
                      analgesics. In 2016, we brought back ~ 14 luggages filled with medications 
                      such as: vitamins, supplements, OTC analgesics, injectable lidocain, 
                      injectable anti-inflammatories, hypertension, oral diabetes melitus, 
                      antifungal creams, and so much more. The team successfuly treated more 
                      than 2,500 patients in 2016. We understand that struggle for small non 
                      profits trying to help patients but doesnt have the means. Medical mission 
                      main focus is access to medications for eligible non profit organizations 
                      providing healthcare to indigent patients. For more information please
