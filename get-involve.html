                  <p>The vission of this charity 1997 is to provide borehole, Pipe, wells and 
                    if difficult hand daug-wells, People who live in such communities mostly 
                    peasant farmers who are well known for its small farm operations, including 
                    raising crops and animals for family consumption. Mostly communities have a 
                    sourcce of drinking water mainly streams, hand daug-well or a river body. 
                    These are not sustainable for healthy living so these projects resolve alot 
                    of problems they face in health, accessability and reliable ways to get clean water.</p>
                  <p>An organization that advocates for global responsibility, the World Wear Project 
                    estimates that the average person discards approximately 70 pounds of clothing and 
                    shoes each year. Of this amount, a large percentage of these items end up in costly 
                    and limited landfill space in spite of the availability of more viable, socially 
                    conscious alternatives, such as recycling, repurposing, and donating.</p>
                  <p>Our medical mission is working in the health industry to provide the best and 
                    free medical care that believes that a different kind of healthcare system is 
                    possible in our world, where every patient could  benefit from advanced medical 
                    treatment regardless of their social standards or financial ability to pay. 
                    The medical charity is working not only to treat diseases but to provide long 
                    term solutions to improve health. These organizations have brought about a 
                    revolutionary change by introducing medical crowdfunding platforms, to make 
                    sure that donors can reach out to the patients directly with their generous support.</p>

                <p><h4>Help us meet our fianancial targets</h4></p>
                <p>Charity has been part of human culture for thousands of years. There are 
                  numerous instances of charitable acts in ancient civilizations dating back 
                  as far as 2500 BCE (or 4,500 years ago), which is around the time the Egyptians 
                  were building the pyramids. More recently over the last 30 years or so, donations 
                  to charitable organizations have increased consistently year-over-year, far 
                  outpacing the rate of inflation. Today, charitable giving is a core value of 
                  western culture with over 95% of U.S. households donating to charity in 2013. 
                  Fund raising has sorted most of our budget deficit and has Kept the organisation 
                  going.Every organization needs money to stay afloat. Nonprofits are no exception 
                  to this rule. Money is a frequent topic of conversation amongst nonprofit 
                  professionals, and discussions about finances become even more heated during 
                  economically unstable times.</p>
                <p>On one hand, there is seemingly a multitude of funding models to choose from 
                  which can create some confusion. On the other hand, some nonprofits still feel 
                  stuck and limited in their options.While its a common practice among most 
                  nonprofits to seek funding from multiple sources, research has shown that 90% 
                  of our financial streams come from these fund raising activities that we carry out.</p>

                  <p>“No one has ever become poor by giving” is a famous quote by Anne Frank that 
                    captures the heart of many people. Charity is a major mood-booster that 
                    implicitly invigorates the donors lives. Its benefits even extend far beyond 
                    tax reductions and recognitions. Accordingly, studies reveal that people who 
                    engage in charities feel more fulfilled and happier than without. Though 
                    charities cover a broad range of missions, they all have a similar objective 
                    to promote social welfare to the less fortunate.</p>
                    <p>This organization relys on donations are becoming increasingly sophisticated 
                      in how we share their stories and spread their messages. Social media has 
                      revolutionized many organizations entire models now that charities and nonprofits 
                      can speak directly to and engage with individual followers. We thought it would be 
                      helpful to shift our frame of reference a bit and examine some successful efforts 
                      in charity marketing. Below are 10 charities and nonprofits getting their message 
                      out through innovation and marketing best practices. We will examine what worked 
                      for each organization so you can try to model their success with your own efforts.</p>

                  <p>She gave me a pledge card, a card promising an annual gift of $5, $10, or 
                    $25 toward the support of the Unity mission. I filled it out under the hot 
                    light of the projector. The name and address spaces were much too short, 
                    unless you wrote a very fine hand or unless your name was Ed Poe and you 
                    lived at 1 Elm St. Through their donations and work for voluntary 
                    organizations, the charitable rich exert enormous influence in society. 
                    As philanthropists, they acquire status within and outside of their class. 
                    Although private wealth is the basis of the hegemony of this group, 
                    philanthropy is essential to the maintenance and perpetuation of the upper 
                    class in the United States. </p>
                    <p>In this sense, nonprofit activities are the 
                    nexus of a modern power elite. This charity knows and serve are working 
                    hard to fulfill their core mission. We often dont have the resources and 
                    expertise to put together the essential elements of a successful planned 
                    giving program; thats where we come in. Our passion is to help organizations 
                    concentrate on carrying out their core mission without the daily concerns of 
                    funding. We help them learn how to solicit, attract, and tap into larger 
                    funding sources through tax-exempt planning. With our help, they can do 
                    this without incurring huge staffing and operational costs.</p>

                    verb agree to serve…. You dont have to know the second theory of

                  <p><h4>Spend your holidays and take part in our programs</h4></p>
                  <p>Our research uncovered many great technology solutions that make it much 
                    easier to get and promote inventory, easier for attendees to place bids 
                    and to see where they stand and to see when they are outbid. All of this 
                    can now be done from your iPhone or smartphone! Higher end events can display 
                    a “big board” showing the total amount raised during the event and show 
                    winning bids on a giant screen TV. The pioneers in this market started out 
                    by bringing in several hundred thousand dollars of equipment and staff to 
                    support the event. The industry is quickly gravitating to what we believe 
                    makes the most sense- Mobile bidding using iPhones/ Smartphones. Studies 
                    have shown that implementing mobile technology can increase auction proceeds 
                    by as much as 300%! Each of the companies below offer some form of mobile 
                    bidding and each is in different stages of development. Each offers pros and cons 
                    in terms of reliability, user interface and pricing. Contact us and we will be happy 
                    to give you our thoughts on each solution and help you identify the right technology 
                    partner for your next event. When talking to potential technology (and service) 
                    partners, here are some questions to ask:
                    <ul>
                      <li>How long have you been in business?</li>
                      <li>How many events do you do in our area?</li>
                      <li>Can you provide some references? Show results before and after an event used your technology?</li>
                      <li>How do I upload the items into your system? What is the process? How long does it take?</li>
                      <li>What level of service do you provide pre-event, on event day and post event?</li>
                      <li>Do patrons have to register or sign up for special services or data plans to use your system?</li>
                      <li>Who manages the events and collects cash donations ?</li>
                      <li>Can patrons donate anywhere within the venue? Are the features available online before the event?</li>
                      <li>Who can be a patron?</li>
                  </ul>
